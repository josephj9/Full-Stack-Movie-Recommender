## Project Overview

Full-Stack Movie Recommender is a web application that helps users discover new movies through intelligent recommendations. Combining natural language processing and collaborative filtering, this project delivers personalized movie suggestions in an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## How It Works

1. **Content-Based Recommendations:**  
   The app first uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to process movie titles and descriptions. This allows users to search for movies with similar names or filter results by genre, helping them quickly find movies related to their interests.

2. **Collaborative Filtering:**  
   The system further enhances recommendations by analyzing user ratings and preferences. By leveraging collaborative filtering techniques, the app suggests movies that users with similar tastes have enjoyed, providing more accurate and personalized recommendations.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
